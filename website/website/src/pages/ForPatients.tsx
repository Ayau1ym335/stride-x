    },
    {
        question: "How long do I need to wear the sensor each day?",
        answer: "For best results, wear the sensor during your normal daily activities—typically 4-8 hours. The more you wear it, the better your trends will be. You don't need to do anything special; just go about your day.",
    },
    {
        question: "Will my insurance cover NMove?",

    },
    {
        question: "How accurate is the data?",
        answer: "NMove uses research-grade sensors similar to those used in clinical gait labs. While not intended for diagnosis, the data is reliable enough to track trends and support meaningful conversations with your care team.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can I share my data with my doctor?",
        answer: "Yes! You can generate a one-page summary report anytime and share it via email or print. The report is designed to be reviewed quickly, so it won't take up your doctor's valuable time.",
    },
    {
        question: "What if I have multiple conditions affecting my gait?",
        answer: "NMove tracks overall movement patterns rather than specific conditions. This makes it useful for anyone with gait concerns, regardless of the underlying cause. Your clinician can interpret the trends in the context of your specific situation.",
    },
    {
        question: "Is there a mobile app?",
        answer: "Yes, NMove includes a smartphone app for iOS and Android. The app displays your trends, lets you add notes, and generates reports for your appointments.",
    },
    {
        question: "What happens to my data if I cancel?",
        answer: "You can export all your data before canceling. We retain your data for 30 days after cancellation, then permanently delete it unless you request earlier deletion.",
